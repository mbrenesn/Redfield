# Redfield
Equilibrium/Out-of-equilibrium calculations using Redfield master equation with reaction coordinates

## Description

This application solves for steady states of a central quantum system coupled to either 1 or 2 reservoirs. Several drivers are implemented in [drivers](https://github.com/mbrenesn/Redfield/drivers)
